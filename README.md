# AI---Powered-Anlaytics-Internship
The AI Powered Analytics Internship Program offers hands-on experience in data science and AI through real-world projects. Interns explore customer behavior, climate trends, stock price forecasting, and build NLP-based spam filters, gaining valuable skills in data analysis, machine learning, and time series modeling. 

## Phase 1:

### Normal Task: Customer Behavior Analysis

Develop a data analysis project that focuses on understanding and analyzing customer behavior based on transactional data. The goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to derive valuable insights into customer preferences, purchasing patterns, and overall behavior.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Data Loading:** Import and explore the transactional data.
- **Data Exploration:** Analyze customer behavior, preferences, and trends.
- **Feature Engineering:** Derive additional features for deeper insights.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Group customers based on common characteristics.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify purchasing patterns and trends.

### Golden Task: Time Series Analysis with Stock Prices

Embark on a time series analysis project using a dataset with a time component, specifically historical stock prices. The objective is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from temporal data, enhancing the understanding of stock price movements over time.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Dataset Selection:** Choose a dataset with historical stock prices.
- **Time Series Exploration:** Analyze temporal patterns and trends.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant features for modeling.
- **Model Building:** Develop time series models for predicting stock prices.

## Phase 2:

### Normal Task: Climate Data Analysis

Undertake a comprehensive climate data analysis project to explore and understand historical climate patterns and trends. The objective is to derive valuable insights from climate data, providing a better understanding of weather conditions over time.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Climate Data Loading:** Import and explore historical climate data.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify climate patterns and trends.
- **Visualization:** Create visualizations to represent climate data.
- **Insights Derivation:** Derive insights into historical weather conditions.

### Golden Task: Spam Filter using NLP and Machine Learning

Develop a robust Spam Email Filter using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The goal is to create an intelligent system capable of accurately classifying emails as either spam or legitimate (ham) based on their content and linguistic features.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Dataset Preparation:** Collect and preprocess email data for training.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant features from email content.
- **Model Training:** Train machine learning models using NLP techniques.
- **Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the spam filter model.
- **Integration:** Implement the spam filter into an email system.
